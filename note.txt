3. Create an ecommerce back end -> the users are -> super admin, admin, customer

a. super admin can login and CRUD products and view, edit or delete orders placed by various customers

b. customer can sign up and login (using mobile and email otp), use the right validations here, also needs social media login

c. customer will get a cart. a cart is a storage that will store items placed by a customer, so this means, every user has their own cart, they can add or delete and edit items in the cart

d. customer can also take this cart to checkout, if the session changes, the cart does not lose the information.

e. customers can favourite a product, save to Wishlist and store multiple addresses, they need to be able to create a profile (name, phone number, address, email, password, profile pic) and can change any of these things as and when required. customers can also save multiple addresses and cards.

f. we have to maintain history of all the previous orders placed by the customer, and each order will have a unique order id and also have statuses assigned for example, pending, completed, processing, cancelled etc.

g. admins are subordinates of super admin that have access only to specific roles, so the super admin can add a new admin and specify the roles to an admin (for example, the super admin can say that a particular admin has access to only the users list or only to orders or only to products)

h. when a user logs in, he can see complete list of products and place them in cart -> checkout -> see history etc. (this is the flow)
